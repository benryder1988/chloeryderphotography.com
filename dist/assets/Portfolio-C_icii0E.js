The ever-cheerful Luis, eagerly anticipating his summer holiday, welcomed us. We sipped a refined, white wine made with the grape varieties in Corsica, its crisp freshness immediately cooling us in the warm evening air, while seated on slightly slanted chairs outside and surrounded by patrons enjoying platters of cold meats and cheeses. The air was filled with the anticipation of a long summer, occasionally punctuated by soft and upbeat music from inside the establishment.
